      Background Research
                        
  I utilised pandas and matplotlib to perform calculations. In created a dataframe to create the Congenital Hypothyroidism dataset. I obtained the summary statistics of the dataset by calling the functions df.describe() and df.info(). I saved these results as a CSV file and then used a online CSV converter to markdown (convertcsv.com) in order to include it as a table in the READme file. 
  
                                                         Introduction
  
  Hypothyroidism is a congenital versus inherited disorder in most incidences.  It is endocrine in its nature, and causes failure of the thyroid gland to release thyroxine.  The condition has a number of different etiologies. Some patients may have a very tiny thyroid gland in their neck or an absent gland and more have no ability to produce the hormone thyroxine. It is estimated that one in every 3,500 infants born in Ireland may have CH.  

                                                        Thyroid Ectopia
  
  Thyroid ectopia is a form of thyroid dysgenesis caudsed by a poor ectopic position of the thyroid gland that results in primary congenital hypothyroidism, which is a permanent thyroid deficiency that is present from birth.
  
  
                                                       Dyshormonogenesis
                                                       
  Thyroid dyshormonogenesis is due to a genetic anomaly in the processing of thyroid hormones.

Patients develop hypothyroidism with a goiter. It is owing to either a lack of thyroid enzymes, or a difficulty in concentrating, or lack of productive binding. This is due to inefficient production of thyroid hormones due to a lack of peroxidase or dehalogenase enzymes from birth.
  
  
  
                                                         Athyreosis 


A rare form of thyroid dysgenesis causing no presence of thyroid tissue leading to primary congenital hypothyroidism, a permanent thyroid deficiency that is always congenital in nature.
