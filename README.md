      Background Research
                        
  I chose the topic of Congenital Hypothyroidism for the purposes of this study as I have a personal interest owing to my daughter being diagnosed with the condition at 10 days old. Her condition is permanent and she will be medicated for life. She was diagnosed by the heel prick test and was medicated immediately thus her prognosis is good but the same can not be said for a child born in a third world country where diagnosis, prognosis and treatment outlook is poor which can lead to serious mental and physical deterioration. I utilised pandas and matplotlib to perform calculations.  
  
       The Dataset
   
  
  I created a dataframe to form the Congenital Hypothyroidism dataset. I obtained the summary statistics of the dataset by calling the functions df.describe() and df.info(). I saved these results as a CSV file and then used a online CSV converter to markdown (convertcsv.com) in order to include it as a table in the READme file. 
  
                                                         Introduction
  
  Hypothyroidism is a congenital versus inherited disorder in most incidences.  It is endocrine in its nature, and causes failure of the thyroid gland to release thyroxine.  The condition has a number of different etiologies. Some patients may have a very tiny thyroid gland in their neck or an absent gland and more have no ability to produce the hormone thyroxine. It is estimated that one in every 3,500 infants born in Ireland may have CH. Blood level testing involves the monitoring of both TSH and T4 levels. The hypothalamus releases thyroid releasing hormone (TRH), which activates thyrotrophs in the pituitary to release TSH. T4 and T3 can then posit a negative feedback on TSH level, with high levels of T3/T4 reducing TSH and low levels of T3/T4 increasing TSH levels from the  pituitary. The focus of treatment of congenital hypothyroidism is efficient diagnosis and full thyroid hormone replacement. Effective treatment involves diagnosis before age 10-13 days and correction of thyroid hormone blood levels 3 weeks old. Levothyroxine medication is the only proven mode of treatment. 

                                                        Thyroid Ectopia
  
  Thyroid ectopia is a form of thyroid dysgenesis caudsed by a poor ectopic position of the thyroid gland that results in primary congenital hypothyroidism, which is a permanent thyroid deficiency that is present from birth.
  
  
                                                       Dyshormonogenesis
                                                       
  Thyroid dyshormonogenesis is due to a genetic anomaly in the processing of thyroid hormones. Patients develop hypothyroidism with a goiter. It is owing to either a lack of thyroid enzymes, or a difficulty in concentrating, or lack of productive binding. This is due to inefficient production of thyroid hormones due to a lack of peroxidase or dehalogenase enzymes from birth.
  
  
  
                                                         Athyreosis 


  A rare form of thyroid dysgenesis causing no presence of thyroid tissue leading to primary congenital hypothyroidism, a permanent thyroid deficiency that is always congenital in nature.
