      Background Research
                        
  I utilised pandas and matplotlib to perform calculations. In created a dataframe to create the Congenital Hypothyroidism dataset. I obtained the summary statistics of the dataset by calling the functions df.describe() and df.info(). I saved these results as a CSV file and then used a online CSV converter to markdown (convertcsv.com) in order to include it as a table in the READme file. I included the png files on the READme through creating an issue and including their web address in the READme with the alt/html attribute (![alt tag]) before the web address.
